"Thinkin Bout You"

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
